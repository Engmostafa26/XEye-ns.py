This is a simple and fast network scanner to get all IPs and Mac addresses of the running hosts in the network.
You just need to run the tool directly to enter the interative mode or if you prefer using the options, you can run the tool with "-t" or "--target" then specify the ip or ip range.
The tool needs to run with python version 3 and highest privilege.
Example: sudo python3 XEye-ns -t 192.168.1.1/24
